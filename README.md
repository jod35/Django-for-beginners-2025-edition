# The total beginners guide to Django
This is a very beginner series on the Django web framework for people who have never built a web application but may have some Python experience. I am planning to do this over a 12-day livestream session. if all goes well.

**Target Audience**: Anyone with some Python knowledge but not Django or webdev experience.  
**Prerequisites**: Basic computer skills; Python 3.x installed.  
**Tools**: Python 3.x, pip, VS Code, Git (later).  
**Project**: Build a simple Product Review Application.  
**Format**: 1-2 hour livestreams with theory, coding, exercises, and Q&A.

**Notes**:  
- Share code snippets via GitHub.  
- Use analogies (e.g., views as "pages") for clarity.  
- Encourage questions and fun challenges (e.g., "Style in your favorite colors!").  
- Provide links to Django docs and tutorials.
